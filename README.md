# Taxi Destination Prediction

## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the final project of the ELEN0062 course. This project focuses on predicting taxi destinations, adapted from a Kaggle competition. The repository contains the final version of the code in the 'final' folder. Additionally, you can find exploratory Python files in the other folder, which were utilized during the design phase of the solution.
